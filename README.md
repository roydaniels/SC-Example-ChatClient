SproutCore Example App - Chat Client

This is a remake of the sample chat client from the Socket.IO GitHub repo (https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/tree/master/example) written in SproutCore in about 150 lines of code!

Prerequisites:

1. Install Node.js (https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation)
2. Install Express.js (npm install express)
3. Install Socket.IO (npm install socket.io)
4. Install SproutCore v1.5 (gem install sproutcore --pre #Tested on 1.5 rc2+)

To Run:

1. Clone this repository (git clone git://github.com/ud3323/SC-Example-ChatClient.git chat)
2. Go to the 'chat' folder in your terminal and run => node chat_server.js
3. Then run sc-server from the 'chat' folder
4. In your browser, go to http://localhost:4020/chat

Note: 
This is a chat client, so you'll need 2+ instances of the app running to see anything useful :)
There is a blog post coming, but the code should be easy enough to follow until we're able to do a formal writeup.
